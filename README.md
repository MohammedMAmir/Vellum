# Vellum
<br></br>
<p>A full-stack web application to allow the creation and management of D&amp;D Characters and Character Sheets</p>
<br></br>
## Goals 
<p>
  The objectives of this web application are to enhance productivity for both Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) players and Dungeon Masters (DMs) by simplifying the management of game materials. This will be accomplished by providing intuitive tools for players to create and manage character sheets, track stats, bonuses, and skills, and streamline the process of leveling up characters. It also aims to provide a free-to-use platform for new D&D players to learn and enjoy the game without having to commit hundreds of dollars to learning the game. For DMs, the system will offer functionality to create, organize, and maintain homebrew content. The primary benefit of the application is to improve efficiency by ensuring accurate and reliable tracking of character data, progression, and custom game elements, ultimately reducing time spent on manual updates and enabling a more seamless gameplay experience.
